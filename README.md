# single-file-components-for-vanilla-js
Svelte and Vue-inspired single-file components compiler for vanilla javascript

## About
Inspired by the way Svelte compiles your single file components into browser-friendly javascript, I created a simple compiler for vanilla javascript. It also features live-reload, so every time you save changes to a single file component, the build script compiles your code and runs it. Although this is a basic POC, in its current form it does help you to better organize your code.

## How to install?

Clone this repo and run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to run the example components

## How to create a single-file component?

Create a new .html file in `src/components`, with the following structure:

```
<template>
<!-- This is where the html of your component goes -->
</template>

<script>
// This is where your javascript goes
</script>

<style>
/* this is where your CSS goes */
</style>
```

When you run `npm run dev` or `npm run build` the compiler goes through all the components and automatically splits and minifies/uglifies the JS, CSS and HTML into dist/assets. It also copies index.html to the dist folder.

## What it's not

This script is simply meant to help you write code in a more modular way, but it doesn't feature the wealth of extras Svelte offers (template language, two-way binding, etc.). Let me know if there are any features/improvements you'd like to see.
