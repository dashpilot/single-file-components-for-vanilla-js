Svelte and Vue-inspired single-file components compiler

## About
Inspired by the way Svelte compiles your single file components into browser-friendly javascript, I created a simple compiler for vanilla javascript. It also features live-reload, so every time you save changes to a single file component, the build script compiles your code and runs it. Although this is a basic POC, in its current form it does help you to better organize your code.

## How to
